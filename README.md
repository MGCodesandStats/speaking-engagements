# Background

![profile](resize-0251.jpg)

I am a machine learning consultant and educator with a passion for statistics, programming, and data science. I have a particular interest in the use of time series analysis to generate business intelligence solutions.

My educational background is a Master's degree in Economics from University College Cork, Ireland. As such, much of my work has been in the domain of business intelligence; i.e. using machine learning technologies to develop solutions to a wide range of business problems.

I frequently make use of the following tech stack:

* **Languages:** Python, R, SQL

* **Libraries:** imblearn, numpy, pandas, pyramid, scikit-learn, seaborn, shiny, statsmodels, tensorflow.keras, xgboost.

* **AWS Experience:** S3, SageMaker (Autopilot, Ground Truth, Forecast, Studio). Cloud Practitioner Certified.

## Examples of past projects

* Implemented time series forecasting techniques for a local authority which significantly informed future policy considerations for their domain

* Constructed multilevel model which allowed a company to significantly improve their predictions across complex survey data

* Consulted with startup on use of LSTM and Seaborn to implement NLP and visualization techniques

* Delivered extensive seminar titled [TensorFlow 2.0 Essentials: What's New](https://learning.oreilly.com/live-training/courses/tensorflow-20-essentials-whats-new/0636920307167/) for O'Reilly Media

## Portfolio Samples

* [Hotel Booking Cancellations: Classification, Regression, and Time Series Analysis](https://www.michael-grogan.com/hotel-modelling)

* [Image Recognition with Keras: Convolutional Neural Networks](https://www.michael-grogan.com/image-recognition-with-keras-convolutional-neural-networks/)

* [Modelling Volatile Time Series with LSTM Networks](https://www.michael-grogan.com/lstm-rainfall/)

## Other Interests

* Financial Writer. Frequently cover blue-chip stocks across a range of industries. Ranked in top 5% of analysts on TipRanks for stock market analysis.

* Foreign Languages: Chinese (HSK 5) and German (B1). Here are a couple of my translated articles!
